# Object Oriented Programming Concepts

## What is OOP ?

It is a Concept of using something called as an object, inorder to solve Complex problems.


## Class and Object 

### Class: 
It is a user-defined datatype, that holds its own data members and functions, which can be accessed by creating am instance on that class.

### Object:
Object is an instance of a class. When it is defined no memory is allocated. But when it is instantiated, memory will be allocated.

## Main features of OOPs

The four main pillars of oops are given below.

### Inheritance:
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.

There are five types of inheritance:

* Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits properties of a base class.
* Multiple Inheritance: One subclass inherits from more than one base class.
* Multilevel Inheritance: A derived class is created from another derived class.
* Hierarchical Inheritance: More than one subclass is inherited from a single base class.
* Hybrid Inheritance: The inheritance in which the derivation of a class involves more than one form of any inheritance is called hybrid inheritance.



### Encapsulation:
It is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit.

* Increased security of data.
* Reduces human errors.
* Allows access to a level, without revealing the complex details below that level.


### Abstraction:
It helps to display only relevent attributes of Objects and hides unnecessary details like background details and mplementation details.

* Helps user to avoid writing low level code.
* Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
* Increases security.


### Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means having many forms. Polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchical mode inheritance.

There are 2 types of polymorphism:

* Complile time polymorphism: In which the function call is resolved during the compilation process. can be acheived by function overloading.

* Runtime polymorphism: Here  the function call is resolved at run time. Can be acheived by function Overriding.

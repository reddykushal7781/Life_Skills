 ### 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea is celebrating small wins to build good habits. For example, flossing one tooth or doing one push-up and saying, "Yes! I did it!" makes you feel good and motivates you to keep going.

### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

The formula B = MAP (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt) helps in building habits

* Motivation (M): The reason you want to do the habit. Connect the habit to something you care about or want to achieve to stay motivated.

* Ability (A): How easy the habit is to do. Make the habit simple enough so you can do it with little effort.

* Prompt (P): A reminder to do the habit. Use clear triggers that are linked to something you already do, like a routine.
  
By making sure all three parts work together, forming new habits becomes easier.

### 3. Why it is important to Shine or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? 

Celebrating makes you feel good and creates a sense of accomplishment. It helps build confidence and strengthens the habit. This positive feeling encourages you to keep going and makes the habit stick over time.

### 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?


The most interesting idea is that small, consistent improvements, like 1% changes, lead to big results. For example, British Cycling improved by focusing on small changes, which made them one of the best teams. This approach works in any area of life.

### 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book says you should focus on becoming the type of person who does the things you want to achieve. For example, instead of just wanting to lose weight, think of yourself as a healthy person. When you align your habits with your identity, real change happens.

### 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

To make a habit easier, remove things that make it hard. Change your environment to help you. For example, if you want to work out, lay out your workout clothes in advance. Make the habit simple and convenient.

### 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

To make a habit harder, add obstacles or make it less convenient. For example, if you want to watch less TV, unplug it or hide the remote. Adding friction makes the habit harder to continue.

### 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

* Keep junk food out of your house.
* Remind yourself how bad it is for your health.
* Avoid places where itâ€™s easy to buy.
* Think about the negative effects to make it less appealing.

# Learning Process

### What is the Feynman Technique?

A process of learning any topic by first writing it on paper and then understanding it deeply by going through all the complex terms in it, and then being able to explain the same topic to a small kid, can pretty much be termed as Feynman Technique.

### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

From the provided video, I really liked the hiker analogy. Consider everyone is in a race in which everyone's ability to learn is different and there is a possibility that the ones that are slow learners will always feel bad about themselves by comparing to the ones that are at the top. This often leads to anxiety and depression.

So it's really important to keep everyone intact to win the ultimate game; here we are talking about education. If you are a slow learner, you might be useful for more creative works rather than the steady works that normal people do. By learning slowly, there is more possibility of learning it more deeply and effectively compared to the fast learner. Just like a racer doesn't care about the surroundings, but a hiker does. This is something that I really liked from the video.


### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active and diffused modes are the two kinds of states in which our brain will be at any given time. In active mode, one can really concentrate on anything that they are doing or learning. And in diffused mode, it will be difficult to concentrate on one thing; in this mode, new ideas keep popping up in the mind instead of concentrating on one thing.

Herein the video, they mentioned that for effective learning, the 2 modes are essential. Because one cannot be in the active mode for a long time, and if they try to go with it even in the diffused state, it will be extremely inefficient. The idea is to take frequent breaks and let the brain get to the point where it needs to be when we need to learn any new thing.

### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

The four steps mentioned in the video are

* Deconstruct the skill - Try to make the whole task into smaller sub tasks.
* Learn enough to self-correct - Just learn something up to a certain point and then practice it to check if you are making any mistakes. This process ceases to get done when we don't try to practice at all, that is, if we just keep on studying about it instead of self-testing frequently.

* Remove practice barriers - Take care of all the things that you know will take away your focus from the subject at the time of studying.

* Practice for atleast 20 hours - Practicing all the basics for 20 hours will make you feel you are not stupid and also helps in getting to the complex parts that show up next time.


### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

* First and most important one is to avoid distractions like social media around me when I am working and keep an eye on the clock to check how much time I am taking for a topic.

* At the same time, I will make sure to learn 100% of whatever I am learning and make notes of it and try to revise it frequently.

* I will make sure of learning it, such that I will be able to explain it to a toddler.

* And finally, I will try to interact with as many people as possible and learn about their story and increase my social skills.

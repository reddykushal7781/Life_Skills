### Sexual Harassment:
Any unwelcome verbal, visual, or phusical conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive and affects working conditions or makes a hostile work environment.


## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

### Verbal Harassment:
This is most common type, which includes 
* Comments about a person's body, clothing, race, gender
* Repeatedly asking out.
* It also includes threats
* Spreading rumours about someone's personal issues
* Using foul and obscene language on others.

This is the type in which people get's involved when the one who is harassing takes it personal. This involves 

* Posters of other people
* Drawings

This happens rarely but the impact of it will be huge on both the parties involved and company image and the work environment of the other people. It totally changes because there will be lot of pressure on the company if this kind of harassment goes public.
This includes

* Impeding or blocking movement.
* Inappropriate touching.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

Generally in any firm, there will be a detailed and well developed procedures in order to deal with these situations. It is the employer's responsibility to let the employees know what kind of procedure to follow if they ever encounter these incidents. 

* If I ever face or witness any of such incident or repeated incidents the immediate action of mine would be reporting it to the higher management or the one's who specifically got appointed for such purpose.

* I will make sure that I would not share these details with many co-workers except for the one's I trust, because it may get public and entire company's image will be on stake.

* I will try to less people included in such issues for faster resolvement.

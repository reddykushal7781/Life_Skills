# Grit and Growth Mindset

###  Grit

The video gives an introduction to the phrase grit, which is basically the strong mindset of focusing on the long term goals for long time. This seems simple but very rare quality. The people who are more grittier leads the life like it is a marathon, rather then a sprint.

### Introduction to Growth Mindset

The video gives a brief idea about the two categories of people:

* People with fixed mindset : These people think that talent and skill are both inbuilt. They can't get better by any amount of training. So basically they don't try the things that are currently out of their league.  

* People with Growth mindset : These people believe that talent and skill are some sort of things that can be trained and developed, instead of thinking that they are inbuilt. By practicing a particular skill for more number of times they can eventually get better.


### Understanding Internal Locus of Control

The Locus of control is a term used to look at the peception of an individual on their ability to do things. It can be either internal or external, external locus of control is a state in which the people think that their effort in the work done is highly dependent  on the external environments like weather, co-workers or the work environment. 

When it comes to Internal locus of control, people in this state believe that how ever they do, either good or average, they did it with complete control of their mind. There is scope of getting better if you try the things multiple times, which happens in this state of mind, because the person is accountable for whatever he has done and is actually ready to get better.


### How to build a Growth Mindset

The key points mentioned in the video are:

* Believing that I can figure things out when needed amd get better at it.
* Today is not a good predictor for the future you. This simply is not possible.
* Do not limit your abilities in your mind by today's perspective.
* Do not hate the process when it gets very tough, that is just a part of the process.
* Honor the hardships and deal with them.


### What are your ideas to take action and build Growth Mindset?

Building the Growth mindset is very much essential for a good software developer(like me). Because he should be enthusiastic about learning new things, which is very much useful for a good career in software industry.

When ever I learn a new thing, I learn it 100%. That is I can explain it toany one to the core of it. This helps me building confidence and make tommorow more interesting and easy.
